During my 1-year internship at Microsoft Taiwan since July in 2022,
I joined the group, Microsoft Technology Center (MTC).
I was responsible for developing some proof-of-concept projects for demo purposes,
assisting full-time employees when there were guests visiting the office,
and serving as a teaching assistant in workshops.

For example, I developed a Word [Office Add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) that uses [Azure OpenAI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/) to help users edit their writings with GPT models.
This add-in allows them to translate sentences, summarize meeting transcripts, or do whatever they can ask the model to do.
Besides, I deployed a [Microsoft's FHIR server](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server) to our on-premisies infrastructure with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/what-is-aks) and built a simple web frontend for it.
[FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is a healthcare data standard that allows for the exchange of electronic health records.
By deploying it on-premisies, we can ensure compliance with regulations in Taiwan.

Just before the end of my internship, my mentor encouraged me to share my work with the public.
I took his advice and made my projects available on GitHub.
The following are the projects I finished.

export const repos = [
  'AOAI-for-Word',
  'AOAI-for-Word-backend',
  'fhir-frontend',
  'fhir-backend-aks',
  'ft-prepare',
];

<div columns-3 gap-2 content-margin>
  {
    repos.map(repo => (
      <GitHubCard
        user="Alan-Kuan"
        repo={repo}
      />
    ))
  }
</div>

Besides building demos, I sometimes assisted the tour when guests visiting our office.
I was mainly responsible for showing internal demos that utilize Azure services or introducing Microsoft's products,
such as Teams, HoloLens or Surface.
In addition, I sometimes attended events or went to other companies with full-time employees in my group to present HoloLens or introduce Azure services.
The following pictures show 2 of the events I have participated in.

Apart from work, I had many opportunities to different activities,
like matching with mentors, intern events, department gathering, just to name a few.
One of the biggest events for interns was "leadership camp,"
held by voluntary interns and held in our winter vacation.
Interns were divided into teams and participated in activities encouraging team spirit like brain storming a project.
This event let me know interns in other department better and make some friends.

I learned a lot and enjoyed my time at Microsoft.
I am happy to share my experiences there with you.
