As part of my 1-year internship at Microsoft Taiwan since July 2022,
I was responsible for developing some proof-of-concept projects for demo purposes.
For example, I developed a Word [Office Add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) that uses [Azure OpenAI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/) to help users edit their writings with GPT models.
This add-in allows them to translate sentences, summarize meeting transcripts, or do whatever they can ask the model to do.
Besides, I deployed a [Microsoft's FHIR server](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server) to our on-premisies infrastructure with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/what-is-aks) and built a simple web frontend for it.
[FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is a healthcare data standard that allows for the exchange of electronic health records.
By deploying it on-premisies, we can ensure compliance with regulations in Taiwan.

Just before the end of my internship, my mentor encouraged me to share my work with the public.
I took his advice and made my projects available on GitHub.
The following are the projects I finished.
I am happy to share my experiences at Microsoft.


export const repos = [
  'AOAI-for-Word',
  'AOAI-for-Word-backend',
  'fhir-frontend',
  'fhir-backend-aks',
  'ft-prepare',
];

<div grid="~ cols-1 lg:cols-2 xl:cols-3" gap="2">
  {
    repos.map(repo => (
      <GitHubCard
        user="Alan-Kuan"
        repo={repo}
      />
    ))
  }
